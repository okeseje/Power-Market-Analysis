# Power Market Analysis and Trading Strategy Development (Python)

This project analyzes historical power market data from ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) North Hub to identify potential trading opportunities and simulate the performance of various trading strategies.

## Data

Hourly price data from 2020 to 2023 was obtained from the EIA and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.  The data is stored in `data/ercot_north_hub_hourly_prices_2020-2023.csv`.

## Methodology

The project employs time series analysis, regression analysis, and statistical methods to understand market dynamics.  Two trading strategies are implemented: Mean Reversion and Simple Moving Average Crossover.  The performance of these strategies is backtested and optimized using historical data.

## Code

The main analysis script is located in `src/analysis.py`.  It uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Results

The project provides visualizations of price trends, trading signals, and strategy performance.  A summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) for each strategy is also included.  (Add specific results here after running your code).

## Usage

To run the analysis, clone this repository and execute `analysis.py` using Python.  Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
